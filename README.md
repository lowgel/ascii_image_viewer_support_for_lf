# ASCII image viewer suport for lf
this is a bash script that converts and displays images in ASCII format in lf file manager, just in case your terminal doesn't have image support.

#Directions
1. drop the image.sh file in ~/.config/lf
2. add the following line to ~.config/lf/lfrc

'''
set previewer /.config/lf/image.sh
'''
