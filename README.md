this is a bash script that converts and displays images in ASCII format in lf file manager, just in case your terminal doesn't have image support.

Not the most practical solution, but at least you get to feel like a hackerman. 

# Directions
1. make sure you have ascii-image-converter installed
2. drop the image.sh file in ~/.config/lf
3. add the following line to ~.config/lf/lfrc:

```
set previewer /.config/lf/image.sh
```
